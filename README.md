# Algorithms Mini Projects

## Overview / Acknowledgements

This repository contains five mini projects completed as part of Duke's "Topics in Algorithms" course (ECE 590 / MATH 560) taught by Professor [Eric Autry](https://www.ericautry.com). For each project, Professor Autry provided significant starter code. As I describe each project, I will highlight code portions that I authored.
