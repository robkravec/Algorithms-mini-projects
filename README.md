# Algorithms Mini Projects

## Overview / Acknowledgements

This repository contains five mini projects completed as part of Duke's "Topics in Algorithms" course (ECE 590 / MATH 560) taught by Professor [Eric Autry](https://www.ericautry.com). For each project, Professor Autry provided significant starter code. As I describe each project, I will highlight code portions that I authored. 

## Projects

- **Sorting**: Implement Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Testing code was provided, but all sorting algorithms and the accompanying report were authored by me.
- **Depth-first and breadth-first search**: Solve mazes using depth-first and breadth-first search. I coded the DFS and BFS algorithms, as well as most of the stack and queue classes used in these algorithms. Testing code, including code for maze generation, was provided.
- **Bellman-Ford**: Implement Bellman-Ford algorithm to find negative cost cycles in currency exchange rates (corresponding to arbitrage opportunities). I authored the code for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, while the tests and two classes were provided.
- **Edit Distance**: Implement Edit Distance (dynamic programming) algorithm to convert one string to another. Testing code was provided.
- **Traveling Salesman approximation**: Find lowest cost tour connecting cities using an approximation (based on DFS of a minimum spanning tree) that is accurate to a factor of 2. I authored the code for two minimum spanning tree algorithms (Prim, Kruskal), as well as the DFS. Tests and two classes were provided.  

## Skills on display

- Modular Python programming
- Understanding and implementation of basic algorithms
